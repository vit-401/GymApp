## Key Valuable UI/UX Principles used across FAANG / MAANG companies 👇

### 1. Clarity

* Simple, obvious, purpose-driven design.
* Clear hierarchy: one main action per screen.
* Minimal visual noise, maximum readability.

### 2. Consistency

* Unified design system (spacing, colors, typography).
* Predictable interactions → builds user trust.
* Reuse components instead of reinventing.

### 3. Feedback & Responsiveness

* Every action gives visible feedback (hover, loading, success).
* Smooth, quick transitions — feels alive, not static.
* Skeletons or shimmer loading states improve perceived speed.

### 4. Accessibility

* High contrast, large tap targets, semantic HTML.
* Keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
* "Inclusive by default" mindset.

### 5. Performance

* Optimize for speed: lazy-load, compress assets, prefetch routes.
* Avoid heavy UI libraries; focus on smooth UX.
* Perceived speed > technical speed.

### 6. Data-Driven Iteration

* Measure everything (CTR, retention, conversion).
* A/B test before wide rollout.
* Constantly refine based on real user behavior.

### 7. Emotion & Delight

* Add micro-animations, sound, or haptics sparingly.
* Build warmth and connection into the product.
* Subtle joy → long-term engagement.

### 8. System Thinking

* Design for scalability, not one-off screens.
* Create reusable tokens → components → patterns.
* Enables fast iteration and consistent branding.

### Summary:

**"Clarity, Consistency, Feedback, Accessibility, Performance, Emotion, and System Thinking — executed with data and empathy."**
